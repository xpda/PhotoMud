<H1><A NAME="fmwebpage"></A>Making a Web Page</H1>

<P>Photo Mud can automatically create a web page containing tagged images. The web page will contain a table of thumbnail images and optional captions. Any thumbnail image on the web page can be clicked on to view the full-size image. Here's how to do it:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>In Photo Mud Explorer, tag the images you want to be included in the web page.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Select <B>Make Thumbnail Web Page</B> from the <B>Tools</B> menu.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Enter any captions for the images.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Enter any customizing information in the Web Page dialog box.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Click the "Save Web Page" button.</LI>
</UL>

<P>It's a good idea to save the web page in a separate folder. When you save a web page, three things are normally saved:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>The HTML file. This is the web page itself. It contains references to the images and the thumbnail images.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The thumbnail images. These are the small images that appear in the web page.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>The image files. These are the full-sized images, or they can be resized copies the originals.</LI>
</UL>

<P>After you have saved a web page, you can view it in your web browser by clicking on the "View Web Page" button. If you need to make changes, you may want to check the option "Save HTML file only, no images," if the images are correct.</P>

<P><B>Note:  </B>You can make changes to the web page and save it again as long as you stay in the Web Page dialog. After you click "Close" and go back to Photo Mud Explorer screen you will no longer be able to made modifications to the web page, although you can overwrite it.</P>

<P>The web page options you select will be retained for the next web page you make. If you want to revert to the program defaults, click on the button labeled "Use Default Settings."</P>

<H3>Thumbnail Images</H3>

<P>The thumbnail images used in the web page are small copies of the original images. They are copied to the same folder as the HTML file, with "small_" added onto the original image file name. When you make a web page, the thumbnail images appear in the page. Then when you browse the web page, you can click on a thumbnail image to see the large version of the image.</P>

<OBJECT TYPE="application/x-oleobject" CLASSID="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">
	<PARAM NAME="Keyword" VALUE="web page, images and captions">
</OBJECT>

<H3>Images and Captions</H3>

<P>In the upper right corner of the Web Page screen there is a set of boxes that represent the images on the web page. You can click on any of the boxes to see the image and optionally add an image caption to be shown on the web page. You can also select an image in the image list below the image arrangement boxes. </P>

<P>If you would like to reposition an image, use the up and down arrow buttons to the right of the image list. This will move the current image up or down one position.</P>

<OBJECT TYPE="application/x-oleobject" CLASSID="clsid:1e2a7bd0-dab9-11d0-b93a-00c04fc99f9e">

</OBJECT>

<H3>Web Page Options</H3>

<P><B>Number of Columns</B> is the number of columns in the table for the thumbnail images. Depending on the thumbnail image size and the resolution of the web browser's screen, this will determine whether all the images will fit on the screen without scrolling horizontally. Normally in a web page it is better to scroll vertically than horizontally. A quick way to tell whether the thumbnails fit across the screen is to View the Web Page after you make it, and then come back and adjust this option, the thumbnail size, or the spacing options if necessary.</P>

<P><B>Max Horizontal Size</B> and <B>Max Vertical Size</B> are the maximum possible horizontal and vertical size, in pixels, of the thumbnails. The thumbnail images will be fit within these size limits without "stretching" or adjusting the aspect ratio of the images.</P>

<P><B>Cell Border Width</B> is the thickness of the border between the images. The HTML term for this option is "tableborder."</P>

<P><B>Space Around Cell Contents</B> is the space between the images and the cell borders. The HTML term for this option is "cellpadding."</P>

<P><B>Space Between Cells</B> is the space between the cells. The HTML term for this option is "cellspacing."</P>

<P>It's easy to experiment with these three options using the View Web Page button. You can use the "Save HTML File Only" option after you have created the thumbnails the first time. If you set the Cell Border Width to zero the borders between the images will be invisible.</P>

<P><B>Title Font Size</B> and <B>Caption Font Size</B> are the font sizes for the text in the web page. The <B>Font Name</B> can be specified, or it can be left blank to use the default browser font.</P>

<P>The <B>Background Color</B> and <B>Text Color</B> can be set by clicking on the color box.</P>

<P>The <B>Web Page Title</B> is the title that is displayed at the top of the web page.</P>

<P>You can click on the buttons inside the "Add to All Captions" box to add the Image Comments, Dates, and Names to the captions in the web page. Image Comments are internal comments in the image file. You can edit these using the Image Comments command. The Image Date is the date inside the file that tells when a photo was taken or an image was created. It may be different from the file date. Image Comments and Image Dates are not available in all image files.</P>

<P>If "Save HTML File Only" is checked, then the images will not be saved. This is useful for modifying the web page parameters after the thumbnail images have been created. However, the web page cannot be modified after exiting the "Make Web Page" screen.</P>

<H3>Save Web Page Images</H3>

<P>The small thumbnail images that Photo Mud creates are always saved with the web page. Then Photo Mud will ask if you want to save the web page images. If so, the original images will be copied to the folder with the web page itself. You can optionally resize the images when they are copied.</P>

<P>The web page images should normally be saved unless they are already in the folder where you save the web page.</P>
