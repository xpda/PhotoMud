<P>The <B>Image Search</B>, under the <B>Tools</B> menu of Photo Mud Explorer, searches the comment fields of images in any folder of your hard drive. A list of the matching images are displayed and tagged.</P>

<P>The Search Text can be one or more words. A search phrase can be enclosed in quotes. You can select whether you want the matching images to contain <I>all</I> the search words, or <I>any</I> of the search words.</P>

<P>The minimum and maximum dates can be specified for the search. These dates are compared with the internal image dates, which are normally the dates the photos were taken, rather than the date the file was last modified.</P>

<P>When the search is complete a list of images is displayed. You can browse through the list, tagging or untagging images as desired. To display an image on the full screen, click on the small image in the upper right corner.</P>

<P>After you close the search, the images will remain tagged. This way you can print, copy, email, etc., the matching images.</P>

<P>For example, you could search for all the photos on hard drive that contain "Denali." Then, after closing the search, you could easily create a web page with all the photos of Denali, since the matching images are automatically tagged.</P>
