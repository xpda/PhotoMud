<P>Photo Mud can convert several images at once to a single file format, and can optionally resize the images in the process. This is useful if you have a number of images from a digital camera or scanner and you want to convert them to another format or reduce their size for email or a web page.</P>

<P>Here's how to do it:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>In Photo Mud Explorer, Tag the images to be processed.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Select <B>Convert Tagged Images</B> from the <B>File</B> menu.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>In the File Conversion dialog box, select the output file format. JPG is the most popular format for images.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>If you are saving the images as JPG files, select the JPG Compression.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>If you want to resize the images, enter the maximum height and width, in pixels. The images will maintain their aspect ratios. In other words, the images will not be stretched wider or taller; they will only become larger or smaller.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Select the path for the images to be saved. The images will be saved under their current file names in the destination folder. If the destination folder is the same folder the original images are in, then they will be overwritten.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Click the Start Conversion button.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>You can optionally specify a color adjustment to be applied to the images as they are converted. This makes it easy to modify a group of photos that are too dark, too red, etc. You can click the arrow buttons to browse through the tagged images and see the result of the color adjustment before you</LI>
</UL>

<P>The files will be copied to a single folder, even if the tagged files are in more than one folder.</P>

<P><B>Technical Information you probably don't need to know</B></P>

<P>EXIF information is retained as images are converted, including most maker notes.</P>
