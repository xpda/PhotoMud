<P>In Photo Mud Explorer you can copy an image file from one location to another on the hard drive by selecting <B>Copy Image File</B> under the <B>File</B> menu. This is similar to loading the file into memory and then saving it to a new location, but .jpg files are not modified by this operation like they are when they are saved with the <B>Save</B> command.</P>

<P>This command it under the <B>File</B> menu and shouldn't be confused with the clipboard copy commands under the <B>Edit</B> menu.</P>
