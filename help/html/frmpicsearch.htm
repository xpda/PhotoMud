<H1><A NAME="frmpicsearch"></A>Search for Duplicate Images</H1>

<P>Photo Mud can search a folder for duplicate and similar images. Images of different types and sizes will be matched based on the contents of the images.</P>

<P>To search for duplicate and similar images, select <B>Search for Duplicates</B> from the <B>Tools</B> menu. You can specify the folder to be searched, whether to search subfolders, and the tolerance of the selection process. Click the Search button to begin the search process. It may take some time, since each image in the folder has to be loaded.</P>

<P>The searching process goes faster with a lower search tolerance.</P>

<P>When the search is complete, each pair of matched images is displayed, along with the "difference score." A lower score means the images are more nearly the same.</P>

<P>You can browse through the matched images, and delete one of a pair of matches if you want to. The file name and image size is displayed underneath each image. You can click on an image to display it in the full screen.</P>

<P>If there is more than one match for an image, that image will be listed with each of its matches.</P>
