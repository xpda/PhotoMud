<P>The Image Filter Workshop allows you to produce and test your own image filters. A filter is a matrix of numbers that conceptually passes over each pixel in the image. At each position, the matrix values surrounding the pixel at the center of the matrix are multiplied by the pixel values at those locations, and the center pixel is replaced by the sum of those products. In other words, each pixel's value is calculated by the values of its neighbors in the image and its neighbors in the matrix.</P>

<P>Some sample filters are provided, and they can be easily modified. You can also save custom filters to disk, and load them later. Three filter sizes can be used: 3x3, 5x5, and 7x7.</P>

<P><B>Image Filter Workshop</B> is under the <B>Tools </B>menu of Photo Mud Editor.</P>
