<H1><A NAME="fileacquire"></A>Importing an Image from a Scanner or Camera</H1>

<P>Photo Mud supports most scanners and cameras for loading images. To load an image from a scanner or camera, select <B>Import from Camera or Scanner</B> from the <B>File</B> menu. If you have more than one scanner attached to your computer, you will be able to select the device you want to use.</P>

<P><B>Technical Information you probably don't need to know</B></P>

<P>Photo Mud supports the Twain interface and the Windows WIA interface for image acquisition. If a scanner supports both these interfaces, you may see two choices for the same device, each with a slightly different user interface.</P>

<P>When downloading a number of pictures from a digital camera, it might be faster to copy directly from the flash card to your hard drive using a flash adapter and Windows Explorer.</P>
