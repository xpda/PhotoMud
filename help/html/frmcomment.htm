<P>You can save your own comments inside any .jpg, .tif, or .png file by selecting <B>Enter File Comment</B> under the <B>Tools</B> menu.</P>

<P>Comments can be entered under several fields. The Image Description field is the most common, and can be automatically added to the image caption in a thumbnail web page.</P>

<P>There is a list of keywords with check boxes on the Image Comments screen to make it easy to add commonly used keywords to images. To edit the keyword list, click the button to "Edit Keyword List" and enter up to 30 keywords you want to use, each on a separate line.</P>

<P>To add keywords to an image, check the keywords to be added and click the "Add Checked Keywords" button. The keywords will be then added to the image and will be available for Windows file searches and Photo Mud image searches. Keywords can also be entered and edited manually.</P>

<P>Keywords are normally added to the Windows Keywords field, but can optionally be saved under the Image Description field instead. This can be configured in the Photo Mud Options. </P>

<P>Windows comment fields are not available in .png files, so keywords are saved in the Image Description of .png files.</P>

<P>You can browse through the images in a folder using the arrow keys at the lower left of the File Comments screen. This makes it easy to add comments to several pictures at once. When you click on an arrow key to move from one image to the next, the comments of the current image are saved and the next image is displayed.</P>

<P>The F3 key can be used to duplicate comments from the previous image, and the F2 key can be used to clear the comment fields of an image.</P>

<P>To display comments and other image information, use the Image Information command under the <B>Tools</B> menu. </P>

<P><B>Technical information you probably don't need to know:</B></P>

<P>In the newer formats of .jpg and .tif files, such as those used by digital cameras, comments are saved directly to the file without saving the image. This prevents the slight loss of clarity that results when you save a .jpg file.</P>

<P>There is a standard file comment in the Exif format that is commonly used with image files. In addition, there are five non-standard comment fields used by Windows. All of these comment fields save information inside the image file.</P>
