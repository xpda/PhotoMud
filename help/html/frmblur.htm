<P>The Image Blur functions can be used to remove noise from an image, and also to soften the look of an image.</P>

<P>The Average Blur sets each pixel in the image to average of its neighborhood. </P>

<P>The Gaussian Blur uses a Gaussian filter for blurring. This removes slightly more noise with less blurring.</P>

<P>The Motion Blur introduces blurring in a specific direction, making the image look like it was blurred by motion.</P>

<P>The Median Filter is better than these blurring filters for noise removal in most cases, and can be used to remove halftones an image scanned from a book or newspaper.</P>

<P>The Original and Modified images can be zoomed in or out using the command buttons between the images. You can drag the mouse across an image to move or pan the images. It may be useful to zoom in on the image to get a better idea of the changes being made.</P>

<P>Image Blur command is in the <B>Image</B> menu of Photo Mud Editor.</P>
