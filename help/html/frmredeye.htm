<P>The Red Eye Removal function can automatically reduce or remove the "red eye" effect of flash photography. Sometimes when a person's photo is taken with a flash, the eyes reflect a bright red color and the person ends up with bright red eyes in the photograph.</P>

<P>To remove the "red eye" effect from a photo:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Drag a selection around the eyes to be changed. This prevents unrelated parts of the photo from being changed. <BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Select the threshold that removes or reduces the red eyes.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI>Choose the color and the lightness of that color to replace the red in the eyes.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The Original and Modified images can be zoomed in or out using the command buttons between the images. You can drag the mouse across an image to move or pan the images. It may be useful to zoom in on the image to get a better idea of the changes being made.</P>

<P>The <B>Red Eye Removal</B> command is under the <B>Image</B> menu of Photo Mud Editor.</P>
