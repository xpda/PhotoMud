<H1><A NAME="frmcombine"></A>Combining Two Images</H1>

<P>To combine two images, first open both images in Photo Mud. When more than one image is open, you can switch from one to another using <B>Ctrl-F6</B>. If more than two images are open, you will be able to select the second image to be used with the currently displayed image.</P>

<P>The <B>Combine Images</B> command is used to combine the two images into a single image. The image displayed on the active Photo Mud Editor window, Image 1, is replaced with the combined image.</P>

<P>If you check the "Scale to Fit" option, Image 2 (on top) will be scaled so it fits inside Image one. If you uncheck "Maintain Aspect Ratio," the height and width of Image 2 will be scaled to fit on top of Image 1.</P>

<P>If you want one of the images to be converted to grayscale for the combining, you can check that box below the image.</P>

<P>There are several combination methods that can be used to combine the images:</P>

<UL>
	<LI><B>Add</B> -- The corresponding pixels of the two images are added together. You may want to adjust the intensity of the images to produce the desired result. This is sometimes used with the edge detection filters to sharpen an image.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>And</B> -- This "And's" each pair of pixels. It is a logical bit operation than can produce some unusual colors for special effects.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>Average</B> -- Takes the average of corresponding pixels of the two original images.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>Divide Image 1</B> -- Divides each pixel of Image 1 (on bottom) from the corresponding pixel in Image 2. This produces some unusual colors for special effects.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>Divide Image 2</B> -- Divides each pixel of Image 2 (on top) from the corresponding pixel in Image 2. This produces some unusual colors for special effects.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>Exclusive Or</B> -- This "XOR's" each pair of pixels. It is a logical bit operation than can produce some unusual colors.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>Maximum</B> -- The resulting image uses the brightest pixel of each image.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>Minimum</B> -- The resulting image uses the darkest pixel of each image.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>Multiply</B> -- The corresponding pixels of the two images are multiplied together.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>Or</B> -- This "Or's" each pair of pixels. It is a logical bit operation than can produce some unusual colors for special effects.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>Replace</B> -- Replaces the pixels in image 1 with image 2. This just copies image 2 onto image 1.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>Subtract</B> Image 1 -- Subtracts each pixel of Image 1 (on bottom) from the corresponding pixel in Image 2. You may want to adjust the intensity of the images to produce the desired result. This is sometimes used with the edge detection filters to sharpen an image.<BR><BR></LI>

	<LI><B>Subtract</B> Image 2 -- Subtracts each pixel of Image 2 (on top) from the corresponding pixel in Image 1. You may want to adjust the intensity of the images to produce the desired result. This is sometimes used with the edge detection filters to sharpen an image.</LI>
</UL>

<P>The Red, Green, and Blue values of the pixels are combined independently.</P>

<P>Converting one image to grayscale is sometimes useful in combining images.</P>

<P>The results of edge detection can sometimes be combined with the original image to enhance the edges or sharpen the original image.</P>

<P>The <B>Combine Images</B> command is under the <B>Tools</B> menu of Photo Mud Editor.</P>
