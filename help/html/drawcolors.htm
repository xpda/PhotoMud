<P>The drawing color is the color used for drawing lines, shapes, and text in Photo Mud Editor. The background color is used for background areas of an image, such as an erased selection or a new image.</P>

<P>The current drawing and background colors are shown near the right side of the toolbar, the drawing color on the left and the background color on the right. You can hold the cursor over the color to see which is which if you forget.</P>

<P>To change a color, click on that color on the toolbar and select a new color. You can also use the <B>Drawing Color</B> and <B>Background Color </B>commands under the <B>Draw</B> menu.</P>

<P>Another way to set the color is to use Color Sample. This is the eyedropper on the toolbar, or the <B>Color Sample</B> command under the <B>Draw</B> menu. It takes a color sample of the image and sets the active color to that color.</P>

<P>To set the drawing color to a color in the image, click on the eyedropper in the toolbar. The cursor will change to an eyedropper shape. Then click on the desired color in the image. The drawing color will be changed automatically to the color you clicked on. If you want to change the background color, use the right mouse button to click on the color in the image.</P>
