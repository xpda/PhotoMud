<P>With Stretch Paste you can copy an image from the clipboard into the current image, specifying the locations for the corner points.</P>

<P>To use this command, first copy an image into the clipboard. Then select <B>Stretch Paste</B> from the <B>Edit</B> menu of Photo Mud Editor. Next, click on 1 to 4 points where the corners of the pasted image are to be located. The first point is the lower left, the second is the lower right, the third is the upper left, and the fourth point is the upper right corner. The pasted image will be stretched to fit between the points you set.</P>

<P>A rubber band box shows where the image will be located. If you don't want to use all four points to define the location, press <B>Enter</B> when you are ready to complete the command.</P>

<P>Stretch Paste is similar to the Stretch command, but with the Stretch command the entire image is stretched between four points you specify.</P>
