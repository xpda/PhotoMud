<P>The <B>Median Filter Noise Removal</B> is useful in removing noise or small, stray pixels from an image. It is good for removing "salt and pepper" noise, and for smoothing halftones from images scanned from books and newspapers.</P>

<P>The filter works by setting each pixel to the median value of the pixels in the neighborhood, so if there is a single stray pixel that is much lighter or darker than its neighbors, it will be corrected.</P>

<P>The sample size determines how large of a neighborhood to be evaluated for each pixel. The larger the sample size, the more noise removal and blurring takes place. The sample size is represented by the number of pixels across the square neighborhood.</P>

<P>The Original and Modified images can be zoomed in or out using the command buttons between the images. You can drag the mouse across an image to move or pan the images. It may be useful to zoom in on the image to get a better idea of the changes being made.</P>

<P><B>Median Filter Noise Removal </B>is under the <B>Image </B>menu of Photo Mud Editor.</P>
