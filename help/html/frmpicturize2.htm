<P>The cell image size is the size that each cell image will be resized to in the photo mosaic. The aspect ratio of the cell images will be altered if necessary to fit the specified cell image size. If the cell image size is too small, the cell images will not be identifiable when printed. </P>

<P>The number of cell images, along with the cell image size, determines the size of the resulting photo mosaic. If you use too few cell images, the original image may not be identifiable in the photo mosaic. If too many cell images are used, then the photo mosaic image may be too large. The resulting image size is displayed when a change is made to the number of cells or the cell image size.</P>

<P>The Cell Color Adjustment specifies how much color adjustment can be made to each cell image. The program evaluates each cell area in the original image and searches for a cell image that matches the color in that area. If a precise color match is not available, the program can adjust the color in the cell image for a closer match. For example, a cell image may be altered to be slightly redder in one location, and slightly greener in another location.</P>

<P>The Cell Color Samples specifies how many color samples are considered in each cell image. When a cell image is evaluated for placement, a single color of the entire cell image can be used to evaluate its fit, or the color of the cell image can be evaluated in more than one part of the cell. More color samples result in a better photo mosaic, but will require more computing time for the photo mosaic to be generated.</P>
